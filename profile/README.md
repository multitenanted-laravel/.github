Sprout is a collection of packages for Laravel that provide a seamless and easy to use multitenancy solution.
It is designed to be flexible and customisable, without compromising on features.

The [Sprout](https://github.com/sprout-laravel/sprout) package provides the core of the functionality, but there's a 
number of addon packages that enhance the functionality of Sprout, or provide additional features.

- **[Sprout Bud](https://github.com/sprout-laravel/bud)** [WIP]: 
  Bud allows you to manage tenant-specific configuration, with built-in support for dynamically configuring a whole host
  of Laravel's core connections and driver-based services.
- **[Sprout Seedling](https://github.com/sprout-laravel/seedling)** [WIP]: 
  Seedling builds on-top of the functionality provided by Sprout Bud to bring multitenant-specific database support to 
  your Laravel application.
  As well as enabling the dynamic configuration of connections, it comes with a batch of supporting functionality to make 
  managing tenant-specific databases easier.
- **[Sprout Terra](https://github.com/sprout-laravel/terra)** [WIP]: 
  Terra brings _domain_-based identification to Sprout, allowing you to identify tenants based on the domain they are 
  accessing your application from.
  Just like with Seedling, it also comes with a bunch of supporting functionality for dealing with tenant domains.

With more to come!
